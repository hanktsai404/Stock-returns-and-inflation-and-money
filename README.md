Empirical research on structural change of response of stock returns on inflation and money supply. The abstract of the research is as follows.

## Abstract
This article aims at testing the structural changes in the correlation between stock returns and macroeconomic factors. I have tested the quarterly data from 1975 to 2019. The structural break I have set is at quarter 4, 2008, when Fed first implemented quantity easing (QE) policy. This article shall reveal the effects unconventional mone-tary policy has on U.S. stocks. The result shows that structural changes occur in the effects unexpected money supply and inflation have on stock returns. Regardless of expected or unexpected factors, the effects money supply and inflation have on risk premium underwent structural changes at the break point. The result of this study indi-cates that the implementation of QE policy and the change of the main goals of Fed affect the demanded compensation of risk to some extent. Later, I have tested whether the investors estimate future outputs precisely. I found out that the explanation capabil-ity of the prediction to future outputs from stock returns is weak, regardless of data before or after quarter 4, 2008.
 
The data analysis was done by R. All of the data and the R script can be found in the "Data & R" folder.
